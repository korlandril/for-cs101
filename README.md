# for-cs101
bleh
i decided to teach myself how to use github for my cs101 projects because the class itself is so mind numbingly boring and simple as it stands in the third week. It might change, but that's the way things are going right now.

Coding is starting to get more fun and natural for me, I guess. I want to be a wizard tho. I'm like year one House Hufflepuff shit, yknow?

Learning GitHub will hopefully prevent me from fucking up my assignments beyond repair and not being able to reverse it. w00t
